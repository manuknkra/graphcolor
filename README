Implementation Notes
---------------------
	This project is done using Django with HTML5, jquery ajax and javascript. Django web
framwork is used to design the backend. Using HTML5 the canvas is drawn and javascript is used 
to draw the graph with nodes and lines. Solve button will send the adjacency matrix using jquery
ajax to Django python code where it will solve it using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).
CSP is also written in python code which will send back the color combination to the js file and
fill the color in each node accordingly.
